    <p>
      For this ITC505 final project, I built a functional "Lights Out" game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
      The challenge was creating a solvable randomized board. I accomplished this by simulating random valid clicks 
      on an all-white board. Clicking a square toggles it and its neighbors, and if all are off (black), 
      the game alerts "You win!". This project helped me practice DOM manipulation and event-driven JavaScript.
