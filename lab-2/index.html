        <h2>SCENE IV. The Tower of London.</h2>
        <p><em>Enter BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, the BISHOP OF ELY, RATCLIFF, LOVEL, with others, and take their seats at a table</em></p>

        <h3>HASTINGS</h3>
        <p>My lords, at once: the cause why we are met<br>
           Is, to determine of the coronation.<br>
           In God's name, speak: when is the royal day?</p>

        <h3>BUCKINGHAM</h3>
        <p>Are all things fitting for that royal time?</p>

        <h3>DERBY</h3>
        <p>It is, and wants but nomination.</p>

        <h3>BISHOP OF ELY</h3>
        <p>To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.</p>

        <h3>BUCKINGHAM</h3>
        <p>Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?<br>
           Who is most inward with the royal duke?</p>

        <h3>BISHOP OF ELY</h3>
        <p>Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.</p>

        <h3>BUCKINGHAM</h3>
        <p>Who, I, my lord? We know each other's faces,<br>
           But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,<br>
           Than I of yours;<br>
           Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.<br>
           Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.</p>

        <h3>HASTINGS</h3>
        <p>I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;<br>
           But, for his purpose in the coronation,<br>
           I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd<br>
           His gracious pleasure any way therein:</p>

        <h3>RATCLIFF</h3>
        <p>Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:<br>
           Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.</p>

        <h3>HASTINGS</h3>
        <p>O bloody Richard! miserable England!<br>
           I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee<br>
           That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.<br>
           Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.<br>
           They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.</p>

        <p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>For this HTML adaptation of <em>Richard III, Act 3, Scene 4</em>, I structured the content to reflect the play's original format while enhancing readability.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Headings:</strong> I used <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for the title, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> for the scene title, and <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> for character names, ensuring a clear hierarchy.</li>
            <li><strong>Dialogue Formatting:</strong> I placed each characterâ€™s lines inside <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags, maintaining proper spacing and readability.</li>
            <li><strong>Stage Directions:</strong> I italicized stage directions using the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag, keeping them visually distinct from the dialogue.</li>
            <li><strong>Navigation Links:</strong> I included a section with links to the <em>Shakespeare homepage</em>, previous and next scenes, making it easier to explore the play.</li>
            <li><strong>Footer:</strong> I added a footer that dynamically displays the last modified date using JavaScript, ensuring the reader knows when the file was last updated.</li>
            <li><strong>Background Styling:</strong> I applied a light blue background to the navigation section to make it stand out without distracting from the main content.</li>
        </ul>
    </article>

    <footer>
        <p>Last updated: <span id="lastModified"></span></p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var x = document.lastModified;
        document.getElementById('lastModified').textContent = x;
    </script>
