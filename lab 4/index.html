In this project, you will use what you have learned so far about presentational CSS to style a text-heavy page. An addendum to the webpage will explain your reasoning for the stylistic choices you made in your CSS as you undertook this process.

Instructions
The deliverable for this assignment is a webpage made available at the url http://<your domain>/itc505/lab-4/index.html along with a CSS file made available at http://<your domain>/itc505/lab-4/styles.css

The content of the webpage is easy: just copy your essay/resume from Lab 2: Plain Ol' HTML.

For the actual work of this lab, just make the copy of the essay look good. This is very open-ended and subjective so, in order for you to get the grade, you need to "make your case" for your CSS by replacing the content of the addendum section with an explanation of your stylistic choices; explain your choices, not how CSS works or the way you organized your CSS file.

Specifically, in your addendum you should discuss at least the following:

Your font choices
The sizes of your headings and your main text size
Your color choices
Any margin or padding choices for the document as a whole as well as things like headings and
As part of this project, make sure you eliminate any place in your Lab 2 page where you made an HTML choice because of how the element looked. For example, if you decided to use a <h2> tag for the title of your essay because the font size looked better even though the title of the essay is the highest-level heading in the page, change that to an <h1> tag instead.

Make sure to point out any such changes you made in a section of your addendum titled "HTML abuse".

Your page must only "look good" on a laptop-sized screen or larger. You don't have to worry about phones for this lab.

Please remember to include the following footer on your page, embedded before your </body> tag.  Pages that are updated after submission will be counted late.

    <footer>
        <p>Last updated: 
            <span id="lastModified"></span>
        </p>
    </footer>
    <script type="text/javascript">
         var x = document.lastModified;
         document.getElementById('lastModified').textContent = x;
    </script>
